Autodifferentiable Boltzmann solver for the CMB (ABCMB) is a Python+JAX package for differentiable computation of the Cosmic Microwave Background.  ABCMB is **complete to linear order** in $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ cosmology.  It computes the matter and CMB power spectra and includes effects like lensing, massive neutrinos, and a state-of-the-art treatment of the physics of recombination through the companion code [HyRex](https://github.com/TonyZhou729/HyRex).
